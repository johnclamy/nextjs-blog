      bio: 'In 2002, Tyrone got back into film making by the way of writing and directing short films. The first was titled “Long time no see”. This was the story about two friends meeting in a pub. The short entered various festivals. A T-shirt was provided to Tyrone in one of the festivals and he has kept it as a trophy till this very day. With a clear view in pursuing a career in films, he went back to film school, this time in London, where he graduated on a Panico film course. In early 2004, he wrote and directed the short film “The Stalker”. The story was an idea Tyrone had back in 1992 at film school. This film also sparked the announcement of the Jemsea Films Ltd Company.'

We went to a coffee shop near the park and rehearsed it for about an hour, getting the words flowing and what emotions needed to be brought up. With a few slight directions Keith Eyles and Melissa De Mol (credited here as Melissa Anne George), I was encouraged to make it. As we were doing this Darren and the crew were finding a location to film, he found a good place up the road came and got us and we went off to film it. It was an enjoyable day and we had fun doing it. After we celebrated in a pub across from the park. It became a nice evenings drinking. Over the next few weekends Alex Brunning the editor and I put it together then I got Simon Herring do do a nice little musical score and it was finished. It was then entered in to the short film corner at Cannes Film Festival 2010. Had a few more screening over the years.

The crew are having a relaxed moment testing out the costume for Stalker actor Graeme Benson. This second Stalker short was slightly more challenging than the first film due to gory scenes involved. However, we can assure our viewers that no one got hurt in the making of this film. If anything, it was great fun! We all enjoyed it and had a blast. Making films in our spare time can be nerve racking but when creative people come together to make Jemsea Films, they show dedication, commitment and passion.

The idea behind the new channel is to correlate all films into one specific area and give our viewers another outlet for viewing our films. This way we hope to make the viewing of Jemsea films a more social event. Another factor was the discovery of our films. YouTube makes it easier for viewers to search and find independent short films like ours. We will keep you posted on these developments. Stay tuned :)`

Having the right people around you, a story that flows well and with good planning it is possible to do them for very little money. It can be a lot harder than you think but once you get going the momentum and your determination will get it done. It may not turn out like you thought but with a good editor and a great music score no one will know the pain & frustration you went through in making it. The tricky bit is putting all the bits together some scenes will work others won't, things you didn't expect to work do. It will drive you crazy. In a good way (but not always). Hopefully in the end you will have a film you can show the world. Also feed your cast and crew well. That way when you ask them to do it again they might just say yes.`
